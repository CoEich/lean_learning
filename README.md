# lean_learning

This repository are just my first steps into the awesome world of Lean :-)

I'm currently working through the introduction "Theorem Proving in Lean" and trying to solve all exercises. These are in `LeanLearning/theorem_proving_in_lean`.

I'm also solving some exercises from the first chapter of the homotopy type theory book.
